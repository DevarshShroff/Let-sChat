# Let-sChat


SJSU Connect is a real-time communication platform designed to help students and faculty at San José State University connect more easily. The platform enables students to chat with classmates, instructors, and other members of their academic departments (such as Engineering, Science, Business, and more).

Built with Python, the system provides live messaging, department-based chat rooms, and an always-online environment where users can communicate anytime. The goal is to create a streamlined and accessible space for academic discussion, quick questions, collaboration, and community building across the university.

## The project includes:

 - Real-time chat rooms organized by major, department, or course
- Student–to–student and student–to–faculty communication
- Secure authentication for SJSU users
- WebSocket-based live messaging
- A responsive user interface for web access

This platform aims to support student success by giving the SJSU community a fast, always-available way to interact outside of the classroom.
